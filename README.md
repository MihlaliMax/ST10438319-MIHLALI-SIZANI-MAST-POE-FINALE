 Refinements  

*************** 

Home Screen 

I have removed the scroll from the course sections and directly displayed the details of each meal in a non-scrollable layout. 

I implemented an average price by course on the home screen, Calculate and display the average price for each course on the home screen. 

I added a remove button in the course sections, it removes meals in the course sections.

Added Meals screen 

I removed the add meal section on the home screen and implemented it to the newly created Added meal screen where users can dynamically add new meals to the list, view them, and remove specific meals as needed.

Add Meals/ Filter screen 

I implemented the filter by course selection in a new Filter screen component, it works by allowing users to select a course (Starters, Mains, or Desserts) and then displaying only the meals in that category.
